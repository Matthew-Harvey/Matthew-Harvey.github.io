 
data needed

Average Rating
Number of Recommendations

Mean Average Rating
Mean Number of Recommendations

Weighted Rating (WR) = (v/v+m.R)+(m/v+m.C)

m = mean Number of Recommendations
v = Number of Recommendations
C = Average Rating
R = Mean Average Rating

Use Weighted rating in an arr alongside the jobid such as [1.423, 234] and [2.433, 213]

Total Euclidean distance used:

eg.
(((1.423-2.433)**2)+((234-213)**2))**0.5

This gives distance between the all other points.  new array is [1.423, 294942]


Using Pearson's coefficent to find the correlation between all points in turn at all combinations, a closer to x score is preferred.
The recommendation feedback button will determine x by users saying if recommendation is good, keep x.
If negative, the x value will be shifted +0.00005 and -0.00005, hence closer to 0.001 or -0.001 is then prefered over 0.
If the result is postive, the system will move the value aimed back in by 0.00001 to hopefully balance and find the ideal correlation of successful recommendations.

Pearsons Correlation formulae is:

 px,y ... = (X-meanx)(Y-meanY).../ Standard Deviations of X Y ...

eg. prefered result is r=0.012

use array from that correlation and list in order from using WR and Total Eucliean Distance.
This should give the centralised point of the reccommended correlation and therefore a hopefully reasonable job is given, most likely a top 3 list in order 1, Estate Agent 2, Accountant 3, Maths Teacher for example...
